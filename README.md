ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Ryan and I'm a full-stack web developer. I primarily work with Laravel and JavaScript, but occasionally dabble in Go and Rust development.

âœ¨ I've contributed to many open-source projects and packages, including [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) and [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework), as well as released some of my own, most notably [Spruce](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/spruce) and [Alpine Clipboard](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/alpine-clipboard). These packages have had millions of hits in just the last couple of years. 

ðŸ“¦ I also develop and maintain one of the more popular front-end presets for Laravel, the [TALL stack preset](https://github.com/laravel-frontend-presets/tall), alongside [Dan Harrin](https://github.com/sponsors/danharrin) and [Liam Hammett](https://github.com/sponsors/imliam). This package has been downloaded and used more than 50,000 times by developers in the Laravel community.

ðŸŽ™ Just like most developers in 2020, we started a podcast too called [Undefined Variable](https://undefined-variable.transistor.fm/). We talk about some new technologies in the community and things that generally interest, or annoy, us.

ðŸ“° I also write blog posts over on my [personal site](https://ryangjchandler.co.uk). I cover topics and concepts in the Laravel framework, as well as more generalised JavaScript and Alpine.js tips and tricks. I'm best known for my series of posts on [unconventional things you can do with Laravel](https://ryangjchandler.co.uk/articles/unconventional-laravel-auto-validating-models). On average, my blog receives more than 10,000 views per month.
