My name is Ryan and I'm a software developer who primarily works with PHP and Laravel.

I have developed and published a variety of open source packages for the PHP, Laravel and Alpine.js ecosystems, including:
* [Orbit](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/orbit) - a flat-file database driver for Eloquent.
* [alpine-clipboard](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/alpine-clipboard) - a simple clipboard helper for Alpine.js
* [filament-navigation](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/filament-navigation) - a Filament plugin to help build navigation menus with a clean UI.

Alongside those packages, I'm also on a larger mission to take PHP's developer experience to the next level with a suite of tools including a superset named PXP and a brand-new static analyser implemented in Rust called Statan.

[PXP](https://github.com/pxp-lang/pxp) improves the PHP language by introducing new syntax features and extended runtime capabilities including type aliases, syntax for generics and more.

[Statan](https://github.com/pxp-lang/statan) is a project that aims to improve the speed and reliability of static analysis tools for PHP and PXP projects. The goal is to provide a level of analysis comparable to more popular tools such as PHPStan and Psalm, whilst still accurately analysing your code.

These projects involve a huge time commitment to develop and as such, all sponsorships are highly appreciated.
